Work in progress on automated conversion of Moodle content to H5P content. 

**Important**: If you want to experiment with the code youreself, you will need to acquire a Moodle archive of the CSE course and unzip it into `CommonSenseEcon.mbz-expanded` in this directory. It is not included in the repo in case of copyright issues.

Note: if you have an instance of funzo-app, and make `public/assets/workspace` a symlink to `H5P_CoursePresentation-template/`, for a demo of HTML5 audio embeds (easier to arrange than H5P
s standalone audio elements) and file downloads (otherwise not possible in H5P, from what I can tell), in H5P "text" elements of CoursePresentation slides.
